# MITRE_CNP_Project
This was a project I presented in an interview for a spot within one of MITRE's rotational programs.

Although I was not accepted into the program, this presentation shows my understanding of network security architecture, as well as my ability to conduct research on short notice and suggest various detections/mitigations that can help defend against cyberattacks.
